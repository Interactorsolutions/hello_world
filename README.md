# Best-Practice-and-Guideline

This guide is provided to Interactor developers who wish to share their solution.

## README

README.md is used as the documentation for your solution.  
Use the [README-Template.md](https://gist.github.com/interactorsolutions/Best-Practice-and-Guideline/README-Template.md) for consistant documentation experience.

## Branch

Create separate branch for each Interactor release used.  
Example, if you created the solution using Interactor release 4.3.1
